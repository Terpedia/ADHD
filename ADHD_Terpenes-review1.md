# Critical Review: `ADHD_Terpenes.md`

## Findings
- **High – Missing citations across core claims.** None of the mechanistic or outcome statements include inline citations or a reference list; the draft only notes that sources will be “appended once… finalized,” which leaves every quantitative claim unverifiable for readers or ingestion pipelines. This blocks traceability and undermines evidence weightings.
- **Medium – Quantitative outcomes lack experimental context.** Statements such as the “~72% passive avoidance improvement” and mentions of a “2025 controlled inhalation trial” provide neither study design details nor evidence that the work exists; without sample sizes, comparators, or links, these figures read as speculative and risk being misleading if misquoted.
- **Medium – Table headlines overstate certainty relative to narrative caveats.** For example, the peppermint row asserts “Human trials show improved alertness and memory recall,” yet the prose later clarifies that evidence comes from small, non-ADHD trials; aligning the summary language to the underlying limitations would avoid miscalibrated takeaways.

## Open Questions
- Can we surface the specific PMIDs/DOIs supporting each bullet so downstream tooling can validate or fetch them?
- Are the 2025 limonene and α-pinene experiments already published, or should they be framed as hypothetical/forthcoming work?

## Summary
The brief is well organized and balanced in tone, but it needs concrete citations and tighter alignment between headline claims and the nuanced evidence descriptions before it can function as a defensible knowledge artifact.
