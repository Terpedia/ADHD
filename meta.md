Executive Summary (≈135 words)
This umbrella review synthesizes evidence across pharmacological, behavioral, neuromodulation, nutritional, and terpene-based interventions for ADHD, with an a priori emphasis on terpene-containing formulations relevant to product development. The analysis is designed to pool meta-analytic and randomized controlled trial (RCT) estimates from curated extractions; numerical effects, confidence intervals, and heterogeneity indices will be inserted upon finalization of data linkage and quality checks. Provisional qualitative mapping suggests robust benefits for stimulants, modest but variable effects for non-stimulants and behavioral programs, mixed findings for neuromodulation, and small-to-moderate effects for select nutritional strategies. Evidence for terpenes remains preliminary, heterogenous, and largely derived from small trials or adjunctive uses. Practice implications include continued first-line use of evidence-based pharmacotherapies, complementary behavioral supports, and cautious, hypothesis-driven evaluation of terpene formulations within well-controlled trials before clinical or product adoption.

Scope and Methods (≈165 words)
We prespecified a protocol (PROSPERO draft: [provide]) to conduct an umbrella review and meta-analysis. Data sources included MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov, and gray literature (conference proceedings, regulatory reports), searched from 2000 to [dataset snapshot date], with forward/backward citation chaining. Inclusion criteria: human ADHD populations (children, adolescents, adults), randomized or quasi-randomized trials and published meta-analyses; prespecified outcomes included core ADHD symptom scales, functional/academic outcomes, adverse events, and objective attention measures. Two reviewers independently screened titles/abstracts and full texts with adjudication by a third reviewer. Methodological quality was assessed using AMSTAR 2 for meta-analyses and RoB 2 for RCTs. Quantitative synthesis employs random-effects models (REML; Hartung–Knapp adjustments), with heterogeneity (I2, τ2) and prediction intervals. Planned moderator analyses include age group, comorbidity, dose/intensity, intervention duration, and risk-of-bias class. Small-study effects and publication bias will be probed via contour-enhanced funnel plots and selection models. Sensitivity analyses will exclude high-risk studies and test alternative variance estimators. Final pooled estimates will reflect the curated extractions in data/extraction_meta_analyses.csv and data/extraction_terpene_rcts.csv.

Evidence Synthesis (≈290 words)
Pharmacological: Stimulants (methylphenidate, amphetamine formulations) consistently demonstrate the largest improvements on clinician- and teacher-rated ADHD core symptoms with rapid onset. Non-stimulants (atomoxetine, guanfacine, clonidine, bupropion) generally show smaller, slower-onset benefits. Across drug classes, tolerability profiles diverge; stimulants carry appetite/sleep effects, while α2-agonists may produce sedation and hypotension. Pooled effect sizes, confidence intervals, and heterogeneity indices will be populated upon completion of the REML analyses; prediction intervals are expected to be wide in heterogeneous comparisons (e.g., across formulations and age strata).

Behavioral: Parent management training, behavioral classroom interventions, and organizational skills training typically produce small-to-moderate gains in functional and academic outcomes, with variability tied to implementation fidelity, setting, and baseline impairment. Combined pharmacological-behavioral approaches often outperform monotherapies on global functioning.

Neuromodulation: tDCS, rTMS, and neurofeedback yield mixed results. Signal may concentrate in protocols targeting the right inferior frontal cortex/dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, but heterogeneity is high, and sham-controlled evidence remains limited in size. Moderator analyses will test montage, dose (current/intensity), and session count.

Nutritional: Omega-3 PUFA supplementation shows small average symptom reductions, with potential moderation by baseline omega-3 status and EPA:DHA ratio. Broader dietary eliminations and micronutrient blends present inconsistent findings, often constrained by small samples or risk of bias.

Terpenes: Evidence specific to terpene monotherapies or terpene-forward blends for ADHD is preliminary, sparse, and heterogeneous. Trials are typically small, short-duration, and variably report standardized symptom outcomes. Where available, we will synthesize effect sizes and characterize uncertainty; at present, the strength of evidence is insufficient for routine clinical recommendation. Key moderators to be tested include terpene identity/composition, dose standardization, delivery matrix (capsule vs aroma), and adjunctive vs monotherapy use. Comparative strength of evidence currently favors established pharmacological treatments, with behavioral supports as important adjuncts.

Mechanistic Insights (≈170 words)
ADHD implicates frontostriatal circuitry, especially dorsolateral and ventrololateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, and striatum, with catecholaminergic signaling (dopamine, noradrenaline) central to attentional control and response inhibition. Stimulants enhance synaptic catecholamines via transporter blockade/reversal, improving signal-to-noise in PFC networks. Non-stimulants modulate noradrenergic tone (atomoxetine) or postsynaptic α2A receptors (guanfacine), strengthening prefrontal network connectivity. Behavioral interventions leverage operant principles and metacognitive training to scaffold executive function and reduce impairment. Neuromodulation targets cortical excitability and network synchronization; response may depend on individual neurophysiology and montage specificity. Nutritional interventions, notably omega-3 PUFAs, may influence membrane fluidity, receptor function, and neuroinflammation. For terpenes, putative mechanisms span GABAergic and glutamatergic modulation, monoaminergic interactions, and anti-inflammatory/oxidative pathways, which could hypothetically impact PFC network stability and attentional control. However, direct biomarker-linked trials in ADHD are scarce. Where available in the dataset, we will align any reported pharmacodynamic markers (e.g., EEG theta/beta ratios, pupillometry, actigraphy, or peripheral inflammatory markers) with clinical outcomes to evaluate convergent validity and mechanism-consistent effects.

Implementation Considerations (≈180 words)
Clinical translation should prioritize interventions with consistent efficacy and acceptable safety. Stimulants remain first-line in most guidelines; non-stimulants and behavioral interventions provide alternatives or adjuncts tailored to comorbidity, tolerability, and patient preference. For neuromodulation, standardization of protocols and sham-controlled confirmation are prerequisites before routine adoption. Nutritional strategies can be considered as adjuncts, particularly when patient preference favors non-pharmacological options, with expectations set for modest effects. Terpene-based products require caution: current evidence is preliminary, dosing is often non-standardized, and product-to-product variability (chemotype, purity, stability) complicates translation. Regulatory status typically classifies terpenes within dietary supplement or flavoring categories; claims must avoid disease treatment unless supported by adequate and well-controlled trials. For Focus on Focus product plans, prerequisites include: GMP manufacturing with chemotype and batch standardization; validated analytical methods for identity/purity; stability data under intended storage; human safety profiling (including interaction screens with stimulants and α2-agonists); and staged clinical validation beginning with dose-finding and proof-of-concept RCTs using validated ADHD outcomes. Evidence gaps flagged below should guide sequencing of R&D and go/no-go decision gates.

Next Actions (≈145 words)
- Finalize data linkage: verify mappings across extraction_meta_analyses.csv, extraction_terpene_rcts.csv, AMSTAR 2, and RoB 2 files; lock analysis dataset.
- Run primary models: REML pooled effects by intervention class and outcome; compute I2, τ2, and 95% prediction intervals; apply Hartung–Knapp adjustments.
- Moderator/sensitivity analyses: age, dose/intensity, duration, risk-of-bias strata; remove high-risk trials; alternative τ2 estimators; small-study bias checks.
- Terpene-focused RCT concepts: randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group dose-finding study of a standardized terpene blend versus placebo as adjunct to stable standard of care; primary endpoint ADHD-RS; secondary endpoints CPT or go/no-go, functional measures, tolerability; optional EEG biomarker substudy.
- Product validation: CMC dossier, batch release specifications, accelerated and real-time stability, sensory acceptability testing, PK/PD feasibility (if systemic exposure relevant), and a pragmatic post-market surveillance plan.
- Reporting: register full protocol on PROSPERO, publish methods/data in an open repository, and prepare a transparent, reproducible analysis notebook.
