# Research Workspace

This directory groups data, notebooks, and retrieval pipelines for ADHD-focused investigations.

## Structure

- `corpus/` – source documents and preprocessed artifacts used for retrieval.
- `notebooks/` – exploratory notebooks (optimized for Google Colab) that orchestrate analysis and RAG workflows.
- `rag/` – reusable retrieval components, including configs, pipelines, and helper scripts.

Each subdirectory contains its own README describing conventions and expected file formats.
